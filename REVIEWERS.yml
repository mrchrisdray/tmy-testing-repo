# Available options for each branch configuration:
# - review_users: List of GitHub usernames to be assigned as reviewers
# - review_teams: List of GitHub team names to be assigned as reviewers (not used in current config)
# - assignees: List of GitHub usernames to be assigned as assignees
# - exclude: List of specific branch names to be excluded from the configuration

# Notes:
# 1. The PR creator will automatically be filtered out from the reviewers list.
# 2. Branch patterns support wildcards (*) for matching multiple branches.
# 3. More specific branch patterns take precedence over general ones.
# 4. The 'exclude' option allows you to exempt specific branches from a general pattern.

# Full Usage Examples:

# Example 1: Basic configuration for a specific branch
# pull_requests:
#   branches:
#     main:
#       review_users:
#         - user1
#         - user2
#       assignees:
#         - lead_developer

# Example 2: Using wildcards and exclusions
# pull_requests:
#   branches:
#     "feature/*":
#       review_users:
#         - dev1
#         - dev2
#       review_teams:
#         - frontend-team
#       assignees:
#         - project_manager
#       exclude:
#         - "feature/do-not-review"

# Example 3: Different configurations for multiple branch patterns
# pull_requests:
#   branches:
#     main:
#       review_users:
#         - senior_dev1
#         - senior_dev2
#     develop:
#       review_users:
#         - dev1
#         - dev2
#     "release/*":
#       review_users:
#         - qa1
#         - qa2
#       assignees:
#         - release_manager

# Example 4: Using review teams
# pull_requests:
#   branches:
#     "bugfix/*":
#       review_teams:
#         - bug-hunters
#       assignees:
#         - qa_lead

# Example 5: Complex configuration with multiple options
# pull_requests:
#   branches:
#     main:
#       review_users:
#         - cto
#         - tech_lead
#       review_teams:
#         - core-dev-team
#       assignees:
#         - project_manager
#     "feature/*":
#       review_users:
#         - senior_dev1
#         - senior_dev2
#       review_teams:
#         - feature-review-team
#       assignees:
#         - product_owner
#       exclude:
#         - "feature/experimental"
#     "hotfix/*":
#       review_users:
#         - on_call_dev
#       review_teams:
#         - emergency-response-team
#       assignees:
#         - ops_manager

# These examples demonstrate various ways to configure the REVIEWERS.yml file
# for different scenarios and team structures. Adjust them as needed for your project.
